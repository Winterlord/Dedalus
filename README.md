# Dedalus
A school project where a mini-"AI" is supposed to explore a labyrinth.

I was only supposed to work on the `theseus_explorer.c` file and my report (in french) is available in `rapport_theseus_explorer_Daniel_ZHU.pdf`.

If you want to try the code, you need to decompress `environment.zip` (made by Mr Goasdou√© in a Unix environment) and use the following command:

```$ make
$ ./dedalus_explorer Levels/{filename}```
